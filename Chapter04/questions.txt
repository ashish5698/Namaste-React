-- Is JSX mandatory for React?
No, JSX is not mandatory for React. It just makes it easy to write code in React apps. We can do it without using 
JSX as well by using React.createElement

-- Is ES6 mandatory for React?
It is not manadatory but its highly recommendable.

-- {TitleComponent()} vs <TitleComponent/> vs <TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>?
When a functional component is used as <TitleComponent/> it will have a lifecycle and can have a state.
When a function is called directly as TitleComponent(), it will just run and return something.
To be a component function returning JSX should be used as <TitleComponent/> and not as TitleComponent()

-- How can i write comments in JSX?
// or /**/

-- What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></>?
It is a component imported by React which will be hidden in the DOM. React.Fragment is like an empty tag so 
can be written like <></>.

-- What is Virtual DOM?
A representation of DOM is known as Virtual DOM. We need virtual DOM because of reconciliation.

-- What is reconciliation?
Reconciliation is an algorithm to diff one tree from the other and it determines what needs to be updated.
React uses diff or diffing algorithm and the process is known as Reconciliation.

-- What is React Fiber?
In React 16, diff algorithm was changed and React Fiber was introduced. Its a new reconciliation engine which is 
responsible for diff.

-- Why we need keys in React? When do we need it?
Whenever we are building same child, React will re-render everything. But if we use keys, it
will only render the new one. For ex- Suppose we have 4 div and 1 more div is introduced, 
if we dont have keys, React will not know what order those divs have? So, it will re-render 
everything.
If we have different nodes like div,img,body etc. at that point of time we don't need to provide 
key because it will automatically identify by unique tag.

-- Can we use index as key in React?
Yes, we can use it but its not a recommended practice to do so because it can cause issues if 
the order of items is changed.

-- What are props in React?
Whatever we pass in as an attribute in component is known as props. Props is a shorthand for properties.
You pass in arguments and receive as parameters. 
For Ex- 
{RestaurantCard(restaurantList[0])} or {RestaurantCard restaurant={restaurantList[0]}}
Both are doing the same thing.

-- What is Config Driven UI?
When we build a Real world app we control our frontend using a config driven by backend(API)
For ex- Lets consider our food ordering app, in which lets assume there are 
three different cities Pune, Mumbai, Delhi. Now lets say we have some offers going on which are different cities
and we have to show the data in our frontend based on their locations. So, these things will be configured from backend.
